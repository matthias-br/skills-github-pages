## Formating Text in Markdown
A line break is added with a backslash `\` at the end of the line, then hit `Enter` to begin a new line.\
Alternatively, enter two trailing spaces at the end of the line, then hit `Enter`.  
To begin a new paragraph, leave one blank line between paragraphs by hitting `Enter` twice.


How do you add inline blocks of code to your posts? Simply add single backticks around the text `` `sample text` ``.  
How did I add the backticks to the code block? By surrounding them with a greater number of backticks, separated with a space. ``` `` `abc` `` ``` produces `` `abc` ``.
